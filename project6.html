                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>This project was something I worked on over spring break in 2025 to exercise my CAD and electrical skills. 
                        While my club provides transceivers, I had a few days before the launch of my L2 rocket, Project Common Loon, 
                        and wanted to make a special transceiver. See <a href="project3.html">Project Common Loon (L2)</a>. 
                        Why Oscar the Grouch? He's funny and grumpy, with a cynical outlook that is occasionally needed as an engineer in order to properly critique one's own work. 
                        Since Oscar lives in a trash can, my original idea was to put the PCBs in Oscar's trash can. 
                        However, the rectangular PCBs were bulky and fit much better in a Waste Management type of trash can rather than the cylindrical one Oscar lives in. 
                        My next idea was to have the electrical components on one side with the assembled transceiver, 
                        and Oscar chilling on the other side of the trashcan. 
                        I envisioned perhaps an Oscar transceiver antennae and some kind of switch on the side of the box to turn the transceiver on and off. 
                         
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p>Oscar's trashcan was unexpectedly challenging since I had a time limit and was exercising skills that hadn't 
                        been used very technically. Yet, this project was every bit enjoyable and rewarding as it was difficult. 
                        Since Waste Management bins have sloped tops and sides, 
                        I had to design sloped holes for all the threaded inserts on the sides of the box and had to make sure the 
                        holes lined up with each other, as they were at an angle. 
                        All four walls being sloped made any attachment/assembly pieces difficult to CAD as well. 
                        One part that had difficult slanting to work with was the panel that the PCBs and display screen would 
                        sit on in my project. It had large holes to make wiring arrangements adjustable and accessible, 
                        space for spacers, and room for threaded inserts. 
                        I also had to make estimates on how high within the bin this piece should be since 
                        I wanted the screen to be just at the top of the bin so that the screen would be easy to read with the lid 
                        on protecting the other electric parts.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The time constraints on the project led to some different challenges. Instead of an Oscar antennae, I
                         had to use a spring antennae, which was another compact option that fit in the trash bin. 
                         Additionally the on/off switch changed form as I realized that the workspace didn't actually have any switches 
                         like I'd initially assumed. There were only buttons. However, as I clicked my pen while I pondered the issue, 
                         I realized I could use small springs (like those in pens) to prop up the lid above the button. T
                         hen when I wanted to turn on the transceiver, 
                         I could press down on the lid to compress the springs until I pushed the button! 
                         The hinge for the lid was also done in a cram. Due to janky engineering, the morning of the launch, 
                         I dropped the transceiver on the ground and the hinge broke off of the main box, rendering the lid useless. 
                         While disappointing, none of the important electrical components were broken, nor was Oscar himself. 
                         Indeed, the transceiver successfully connected with the AV inside Common Loon and perfectly tracked Common Loon's location and altitude. 
                         Although my Oscar Transceiver box could have been much more structurally sound, I was overall happy with the final product. 
                         In fact, as a teammate and I hiked to recover our rockets, 
                         we used the extra room in Oscar's trash bin to hold snack wrappers and plastic water bottles so we could properly dispose of them!
