                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>This project was a fun project I worked on over spring break in 2025 to exercise my CAD and electrical skills. 
                        I was making an Oscar-the-Grouch-themed transiever. While the rockets team in the Stanford Student Space Initiative 
                        provides transievers, I had a few days before the launch of my L2 rocket, Project Common Loon, and wanted to make 
                        a special transiever. See <a href="project3.html">Project Common Loon (L2)</a>. Why Oscar the Grouch? He's funny and grumpy, with a cynical outlook that is occasionally needed 
                        as an engineer in order to properly critique one's own work. Since Oscar lives in a trash can, my original idea was to 
                        put the PCBs in Oscar's trash can. However, the rectangular PCBs were bulky and fit much better in a Waste Management type 
                        of trash can rather than the cylindrical one Oscar lives in. My next idea was to have the electrical components on one side with the assembled 
                        transiever, and Oscar chilling on the other side of the trashcan. I envisioned perhaps an Oscar transiever antennae and some 
                        kind of swtich on the side of the box to turn the transiever on and off.

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p>Oscar's trashcan was a challenging project since I had a time limit and was exercising two skills that, until now, hadn't been used very technically. 
                        Yet, this project was every bit enjoyable and rewarding as it was frustrating. 
                        Since Waste Management bins have sloped tops and sides, I had to design sloped holes for all the thredded inserts on the 
                        sides of the box and had to make sure the holes lined up with each other, as they were at an angle. Additionally, the design of the 
                        Waste Management trash can meant I need to spend long periods of time picking off supports. All four walls being sloped made any attachment/assembly pieces difficult 
                        to CAD as well. One such part that had difficult slanting to extrude into existance was a plane
                        that the PCBs and display screen would sit on in my project, with large holes so that wires could be fed through to where needed, such as deeper into the box, 
                        where the battery would be sitting. 
                        I had to make estimates on how high within the bin this piece should be since I wanted the screen to be just at the top of the bin so that 
                        the screen would be easy to read with the lid on protecting the other electric parts. I also created a divider between Oscar and the electronics section, as well as went through some 
                        YouTube tutorials.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately, I was not able to make Oscar into antennae because of a lack of time. Instead, I used a spring antannae, which is another compact option that fit 
                        in the trash bin. Oscar ended up just being a 3D printed part. Another challenge came with the on-off switch. While working on the electrical components of the box, I realized the workspace didn't actually have any switches like I'd initially 
                        assumed. There were only these red buttons, which didn't look very cool. However, while I clicked my pen as I pondered the issue, I realized I could use 
                        small springs (like those in pens) to make a spring-loaded button! The main bin had a sort of lip, which I drilled holes into for two skinny springs and a button. The lid 
                        could rest on the springs above the level of the button, and then when I wanted to turn on the transiever, I could press down on the lid to compress the springs untill 
                        I was also pushing the button! I happily soldered the button onto my board, happy that it wasn't ruining the aesthetic of the box. I harvested springs from two of my pens, and set to work. The hinges were also a challenge. I had to make them much larger than was good for the bin, 
                        but when I tried to make them smaller the 3D printing filament had trouble sticking to the sheet. Instead, I CADed them to be quite large, and then hacksawed the extra parts off before supergluing 
                        them onto the lid and bin. Of course, that meant they were pretty weak parts. Overall, I had managed to cram out an acceptable looking Oscar-the-Grouch-themed transiever by the night before the launch. 
                        All I had to do was paint it! Unfortunately, the morning of the launch, I dropped the transiever on the ground while packing launch materials into the car. The hinge broke off of the main box, rendering the lid useless. 
                        This was disappointing as I'd been proud of my janky creation the night before, but it was doomed to happen. Importantly, none of the electrical components were broken, nor was Oscar himself. 
                        And indeed, the transiever successfully connected with the AV inside Common Loon, and perfectly tracked Common Loon's location and altitude throughout flight and after it touched down. Although my Oscar Transiever box could 
                        have been much more structuarly sound, and the CAD was looking pretty ugly by the final iteration, I was happy that it was still functional. So functional, in fact, that as a teammate and I hiked to recover our rockets, we used the extra room in 
                        Oscar's trash bin to hold some snack wrappers and plastic bottles so we could properly dispose of them!
