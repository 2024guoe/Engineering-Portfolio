                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>The L2 Certification is a National Association of Rocketry (NAR) certification that allows certificate holders to launch rockets with I, J, and K class motors with insurance. 
                        To attain this certification, I will pass a test to demonstrate my knowledge of the laws and regulations pertaining to high power rocketry as well as technical rocket knowledge and then successfully launch and recover my L2 rocket.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p>I am designing my L2 rocket with the goal to learn as much as possible within the world of amateur rocketry. 
                        I will be learning how to use Eggtimer's Quasar as my AV component, which allows me to GPS track my rocket’s flight, gather flight data, and have dual-deploy parachutes. 
                        Additionally, I will 3D print an AV bay. One side of the AV will be bolted into my upper airframe, and the other side will friction fit 
                        into my lower airframe, and pop out with drogue parachute deployment. Therefore the AV is acting like a coupler between my upper and lower airframes. 
                        My main chute is stored within the coupler between my nosecone and upper airframe, and that part will pop out upon main deployment. 
                        As I also want to learn how to work with composites, I’ll be adding carbon fiber lay-ups on my fins.
                        My phenolic body tube will be 66mm in diameter and have a 54mm motor mount, and I will be creating my own fiberglass nose cone. I'm using a 
                        pin switch, similar to what I used on Red-Winged Blackbird. I will be flying this rocket on an Aerotech J800T, which is an RMS motor, and therefore also requires some assembly, 
                        which I'll learn how to assemble. To secure this type of motor in my rocket, I'll be using a bulkhead and threaded rod between the bulkead and the forward closure. 
                    </p>

                <div class="column conclusion">
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The build process gave me several opportunities to trouble shoot. Bolting my AV into the upper airframe proved to be quite the challenge. At first, 
                        I thought I could just drill three holes into my airframe and AV coupler and then JB Weld hex nuts into the inside of my airframe where the holes were.
                        Unfortunately, one of the nuts broke off the inside of the airframe while the screw was still inside it, meaning it would be impossible to unscrew the screw 
                        as the nut would just be turning freely inside the airframe. The nut was too far in for my hand to reach, and the pliers 
                        were too wide to fit into the airframe. None of our wrenches were the right size. In the end, I 3D printed a part to act as a wrench to hold the nut in place. 
                        The next time I do bolting work into airframes however, I'd like to come up with a better solution that prevents this ecompletely. </p>
                    <p> Fortunately, there were no problems with my flight, flying over a mile above Earth, at an apogee of 6207 ft. This is only about 200 ft lower than I simulated, 
                        with variation likely due to to drag of the camera (see below) and perhaps the light winds. It pulled 29 Gs and hit Mach 1.6, which was much faster than I had simulated (Mach 1.1). 
                        The only reason I can think of to explain that is perhaps I made my nosecone shape more optimally than I had simulated--since I only used the default Ogive nosecone in Openrocket
                         but I CADed and built my own nosecone to different sizing than the Openrocket had, perhaps my nosecone was aerodynamically better. An addition I decided on 
                        later in my build process was adding a camera to the side! This took some extra consideration on best location and placement,
                        but looking at my OpenRocket simulations, strapping the RunCam to the side of my rocket wouldn't affect its balance much as the 
                        RunCam is very light compared to the rest of my rocket. I ended up getting some really cool video footage of the Earth from my rocket's 
                        perspective as it launched! Overall, I was extremely happy with my flight, and I am now NAR L2 certified!
