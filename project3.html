                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>The L2 Certification is a National Association of Rocketry (NAR) certification that allows certificate holders to launch rockets with I, J, and K class motors with insurance. To attain this certification, I will first pass a test to demonstrate my knowledge of the laws and regulations pertaining to high power rocketry as well as technical rocket knowledge. Then, I will build and successfully launch and recover my L2 rocket. 
                        I want to advance my technical skills and continue learning more about different rocket configurations and their challenges in order to hone both my hands-on skills and my problem-solving abilities.     </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p>To achieve this, I will be configuring my recovery mechanism differently, using head-end dual deploy instead of regular dual deploy. 
                        This means my AV is acting like a coupler between my upper and lower airframes. 
                        My main chute is stored within my nosecone and coupler/upper airframe, whereas my drogue will be stored below the AV in the main airframe above my motor. 
                        In order to secure my motor to my rocket, I’ll be using a threaded rod between my bulkhead and the motor’s forward closure. 
                        I will be flying this rocket on an Aerotech J800T, which is my first RMS motor and requires assembly. 
                        To increase my composite knowledge, I’ll also be learning how to add carbon fiber lay-ups on my fins. 
                        Last minute, I also decided to add a camera to the rocket! Looking at my OpenRocket simulations, 
                        strapping a RunCam to the side of my rocket wouldn't affect its stability much, so placement was mostly up to what I wanted to capture.

                <div class="column conclusion">
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>TThe build process gave me several opportunities to troubleshoot, such as bolting my AV into the upper airframe, 
                        which proved to be quite the challenge. Fortunately, there were no problems with my flight, flying over a mile above 
                        Earth, at an apogee of 6207 ft. This is only about 200 ft lower than I simulated, 
                        with variation likely due to drag of the camera and perhaps the light winds. 
                        It pulled 29 Gs and hit Mach 1.6. The RunCam was also able to record some really cool video footage of the Earth from my rocket's perspective as it flew! 
                        Overall, I was extremely happy with my flight, and I am now NAR L2 certified.
