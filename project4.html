                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>This rocket is hybrid between the L1 I launched and the L2 I plan to launch in April. 
                        I wanted to gain more experience with desinging, building, and launching rockets before going for my L2 certification. 
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p>I am designing Red-Winged Blackbird to familiarize myself with working on avionics and composites. It will be flying on the I435T at LUNAR. 
                        I am using a pre-assembled egg timer AV board with dual-deploy parachute and GPS tracking capability and have 3D printed my AV sled and endcaps. I also learned how to integrate an AV into my rocket. 
                        I learned how to make my own nosecone with fiberglass sleeves and epoxy, including how to 
                        safely cut and sand the fiberglass. Additionally, I CADed and printed the shoulder of my nose cone which now slides into my upper airframe.
                        This rocket is using a pin switch, which I chose because it requires a little more design consideration than a magnet switch or a screw switch.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Red-winged Blackbird was successfully launched and recovered at LUNAR in Snow Ranch, California! It flew to an apogee of 4282 ft, hit Mach 1.59, and pulled an average of 37 gs.
                        One small challenge I had was with the fiberglass nosecone I made. I thought the fiberglass layers would be thicker in actuality, and overcompensated for that when
                        I CADed my jig. Therefore, I had a lip between the nosecone and the upper airframe. Since the airframe was just cardboard on this rocket, I was worried
                        the force of the thrust on take-off would cause the nosecone to deform the airframe. I didn't have the time or materials to remake the nosecone, so I 
                        tried to prevent this by CADing a shoulder that transitioned the lip and 3D printing it with carbon fiber reinforced filament. Overall, I had a lot of fun designing, building, and launching 
                        this rocket! I gained valuable experience with custom nosecone making, sanding and cutting epoxy, general avionics, and troubleshooting.
