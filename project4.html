                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>This rocket is a hybrid between the L1 I launched and the L2 I plan to launch in April. 
                        I wanted to gain more experience with desinging, building, and launching rockets before going for my L2 certification. 
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p>I am designing Red-Winged Blackbird to familiarize myself with working on avionics and composites. 
                        It will be flying on the I435T at LUNAR. I am using a pre-assembled Eggtimer Quasar AV board with dual-deploy parachute 
                        and GPS tracking capability and have 3D printed my AV sled and endcaps. I  integrated it into my rocket, which I had never worked with before. 
                        I learned how to make my own nosecone with fiberglass sleeves and epoxy, including how to safely cut and sand the fiberglass. 
                        Additionally, I CADed and printed the shoulder of my nose cone which now slides into my upper airframe. 
                        This rocket is using a pin switch, which I chose because it requires a little more design consideration than a magnet switch or a screw switch.
    </p>

                <div class="column conclusion">
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Red-winged Blackbird was successfully launched and recovered, flying to an apogee of 4282 ft, hitting Mach 1.59, and pulling an average of 37 Gs. 
                        One small challenge I had was with the fiberglass nosecone I built. I thought the fiberglass layers would be thicker and overcompensated when I CADed my jig. 
                        I ended up with a lip between the nosecone and the upper airframe. Since the airframe was just cardboard on this rocket, 
                        I was worried the force of thrust on take-off would cause the nosecone to deform the airframe. I didn't have the time or materials to remake the nosecone, 
                        so I CADed a shoulder that transitioned between the nosecone and the airframe and 3D printed it with strong carbon fiber-reinforced filament. 
                        Overall, I had a lot of fun designing, building, and launching this rocket! I learned custom nosecone making, sanding and cutting epoxy, and general avionics.
