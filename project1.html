        <h2>Smart Hummingbird Feeder: Detailed Overview</h2>

                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>This project idea was born shortly after a fellow Stanford Birdwatching Club member caught a rare glimpse of a Costa Hummingbird 
                        flying around The O'Donohue Family Stanford Educational Farm. The last time a Costa Hummingbird was spotted in the West Bay area was in 2021. 
                        As I gushed to my friend about the hummingbirds, we decided to create an exciting project: a hummingbird feeder that identifies the hummingbirds' species. 
                        With this identification data, we could record the different species of hummingbirds present in and track their interactions around the Farm. 
                        Unlike the only similar product on the market, which is expensive and only detects common seed-eating species, 
                        our feeder aims to identify rare or endangered species and monitor cross-species interactions.

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p>I recently successfully pitched the project to the Co-Presidents of the Moonshot Club in order to obtain funding for materials to make this project come to life. 
                        We are still in the research and design phase, although we expect to move into the prototyping phase in the coming weeks. 
                        Throughout this project, I will be learning how to work with AI machine learning, camera detection, radio transmission, solar panels, and of course, the hummingbirds themselves. 
                        Other skills I will be exercising in this project include working with PCBs and Raspberry Pi zeros, CADing, and 3D printing, as well as project management and budgeting.</p>
